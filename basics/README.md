# Style Guide

* Use four spaces per indentation level.
* Keep your lines to 79 characters or fewer.
* Use single blank lines to group parts of your program visually.
* Use plural names for lists, to make your code easier to read.
* class names are written in CamelCase and object names are written in lowercase with underscores.
* Modules that contain classes should still be named in lowercase with underscores.
